    description: "E-commerce works for businesses by providing an online platform where products or services can be directly sold to customers through the internet. Businesses set up their digital storefronts on e-commerce websites or platforms, listing products with descriptions, images, and prices. Customers visit these online stores, browse through the offerings, and add desired items to their virtual shopping carts. At checkout, customers securely provide payment and shipping information, and the e-commerce platform processes the transaction. The business fulfills the order by preparing products for delivery or providing digital products/services electronically. E-commerce enables businesses to reach a broader audience, reduce physical store costs, and offer convenient shopping options. Through analytics, businesses can monitor sales and customer behavior, making data-driven improvements to enhance the overall e-commerce experience.",
